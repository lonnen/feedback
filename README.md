# lonnen/feedback

[Holman-style](https://github.com/holman/feedback) interaction via github issues.

### Quality interaction at last!

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/lonnen/feedback/issues/new) on this
project to ask a question, follow up on a missive, and/or suggest a topic you'd
like me to cover in the longform -- as a blog, talk, code, major career change, etc.

I'll try to answer sooner than I would by e-mail. After I've responded I'll close
the issue so that open issues represent a todo-queue, but feel free to follow up with
additional questions on the same thread. Resurrecting closed posts is preferred to
creating new posts retreading old topics.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/lonnen/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Other comm channels

Sometimes you can catch me idling on irc.mozilla.org in #webdev and other channels. 

You can also try to ping me on App.net or Twitter -- I'm @lonnen on both.
